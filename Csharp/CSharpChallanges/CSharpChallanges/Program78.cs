/*Missing Third Angle
 You are given 2 out of 3 angles in a triangle, in degrees.

Write a function that classifies the missing angle as either "acute", "right", or "obtuse" based on its degrees.

An acute angle is less than 90 degrees.
A right angle is exactly 90 degrees.
An obtuse angle is greater than 90 degrees (but less than 180 degrees).
For example: MissingAngle(11, 20) should return "obtuse", since the missing angle would be 149 degrees, which makes it obtuse.

Examples
MissingAngle(27, 59) ➞ "obtuse"

MissingAngle(135, 11) ➞ "acute"

MissingAngle(45, 45) ➞ "right"
Notes
The sum of angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.
