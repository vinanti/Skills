		<h2>Vancouver: My fevourite City</h2>

			<p class="quote">
				My favorite city is Toronto; it is a great city for three reasons which are is to live, work, and for tourism. The first reason is that Toronto is great city to live. It is quiet, clean and safe city to live in. Also, it is multicultural city, which is advantage for us, we could learn about different countries and cultures. For example, I remember when I was in high school that we celebrated the Multicultural Day. On that day everyone wore their cultural clothes, brought and shared cultural foods, also there were some representatives from each culture shared some important aspects of each culture. As a result I learned about different cultures and languages in Toronto.
